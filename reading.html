                    Go placidly amid the noise and the haste,
                    and remember what peace there may be in silence.
                    As far as possible, without surrender,
                    be on good terms with all persons.
                    Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
                    and listen to others,
                    even to the dull and the ignorant;
                    they too have their story.
                    Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
                    they are vexatious to the spirit.

                    you and I, with the garden's beauty
                    and the birds singing.
                    The stars will be watching us,
                    and we will show them
                    what it is to be a thin crescent moon.

                    No time to stand beneath the boughs
                    And stare as long as sheep or cows.
                    No time to see, when woods we pass,
                    Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.
                    No time to see, in broad daylight,
                    Streams full of stars, like skies at night.
                    A poor life this if, full of care,
                    We have no time to stand and stare.

                    She let go of the confluence of opinions
                    swarming around her head.
                    She let go of the committee of indecision within her.
                    She let go of all the 'right' reasons.
                    Wholly and completely, without hesitation or worry,
                    she just let go.
                    She didn’t ask anyone for advice.
                    She didn’t read a book on how to let go.
                    She just let go.
