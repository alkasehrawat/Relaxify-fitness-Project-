                     Running reduces stress through a combination of physical and psychological benefits. The exertion involved triggers the release of endorphins, often resulting in the euphoric "runner's high" that elevates mood. It encourages mindfulness and focus, allowing you to … to concentrate on your breath and rhythm, which helps clear your mind of daily stressors. Additionally, increased blood flow during running enhances oxygen delivery to the brain, improving mental clarity and reducing anxiety.
